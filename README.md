# thought about agile

Sometimes we tend to focus on agile frameworks implementation, arguing which behaviors are considered agile and which are not. We have all been in meetings where we had to convince managers and teams to adopt new agile practices, trying to sell them on the idea that agile is the best way to work, digging in details of Scrum and Kanban, trying to replace the old dogma the with new one. This led skeptical managers perceive agile as a huge risky process lift.

 Thinking about this, I just wanted to go back to roots and share with you the twelve principles behind the Agile Manifesto.

1 - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2 - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3 - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4 - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5 - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6 - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7 - Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8 - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9 - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10 - Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.

11 - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12 - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


Only a cultural shift, can help you create a high performing team.
Replacing processes with new ones may not bring the desired effect, being agile is not about applying rigid processes and it's  not a goal by itself, 
it's a mindset that is focused on  delivering  steadily maximum value with minimum cost steadily, a mindset that make team members humble and egoless so collaboration and interaction becomes fluid and effective , a mindset that  through psychological safety make self improvement  welcomed and  demanded. 

Being agile is somehow an obsession about value delivery, simplicity, reflection and  improvement.
